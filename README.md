# NB Plots

**Update March 2019**: The most novel part of this package, the visual field plots, have been extracted to [vfplot](https://github.com/nbommakanti/vfplot). The remaining functions are likely not particularly useful but will remain up just in case.

This is a collection of miscellaneous helper functions for my plots.
